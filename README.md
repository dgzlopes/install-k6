## F.A.Q

### What does this script do?
- Detects your OS & architecture
- Downloads the latest k6 release and installs it in `~/.k6/bin`
- Tries to add `~/.k6/bin` to your PATH. If it fails, it will suggest you do it manually.
- Checks if there are new k6 versions available and prompts you to update from time to time.

### How do I update k6?

Just run the installation script again! It will download the latest version and replace the existing one.

### Can I pick a specific version?

Yes! You can pass the version as an environment variable:
```sh
curl -fsSL https://install-k6.com/please.sh | bash -s v0.54.0
```

### Can I disable the updates check?

Yes! You can pass the `--no-update-check` flag:
```sh
curl -fsSL https://install-k6.com/please.sh | bash -s -- --no-update-check
```
